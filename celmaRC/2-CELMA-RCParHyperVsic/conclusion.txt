- Added D4DY4 for jPar, as having trouble with lnN-phi term
- Changed to neumann_o2 as BoutException is thrown for neumann_o4
    + Workaround a: Re-implement o4 in ownBCs
    + Workaround b: Implement o4 in BOUT++ (but then should probably change to v4.0.0RC

Results:
========
4e-4 - 4e4 : No noticable effect.
             At 4e4: Oscillations in hyper ~ diffusion
4e7: Negates the fluctuations in jPar (remains in lnN - phi), and oscillations in hyper ~ jPar
