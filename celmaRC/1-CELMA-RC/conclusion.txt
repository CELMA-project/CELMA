Results:
========
CSDXMagFieldScan               - See-sawing in jPar due to lnN - phi
CSDXMagFieldScanHihgerTe       - Walltime reached
CSDXMagFieldScanAr             - Gives non-fluctuating results (check results in own folder)
LeddyMagFieldScan              - Looks like see-sawing as well (need higher S)
LeddyMagFieldScanHigherTe      - Walltime reached
LeddyMagFieldScanHigherTeHalfR - Gives non-fluctuating results (check results in own folder)


Discussion
===========
See sawing found in lnN - phi, but not jPar in 7-CELMACurMomWParamsConstViscClean/magFieldScan - Points per rhoS in y = 1.8023e-01
No see sawing found in lnN - phi in 7-CELMACurMomWParamsConstViscClean/FLAWED_CSDXMagFieldScanAsBurinHSameRhoSAndOmCIAsAr - Points per rhoS in y = 2.3974e-01
In CSDXMagFieldScan: rhoS = 66/1.7332e+03 => rhoS in y = 3.8080e-02
In CSDXMagFieldScanHigherTe: rhoS in y = 5.8994e-02

Have that Ly/rhoS = Ly qB/sqrt(mi*Te) =>
points per rhoS: nz*sqrt(mi*Te)/(Ly qB)
Maybe not such a bad idea to simulate argon after all?

Aiming for pointPerRhoS at 0.2:
nz = 66
mi = m_p
Te = 2.5
Ly = 2.8
B  = 0.1

Keeping all fixed but Ly gives Ly ~ 0.533
Keeping all fixed but B  gives B  ~ 0.2
Keeping all fixed but Te gives Te ~ 68
Keeping all fixed but nz gives nz ~ 347

Should really find another device...
Trying Leddy decive
