    !!! NOTE: Probably not high gradients ue parallel artificial viscosity
              which is the problem, as equally high gradients are found in runs that
              works
    + nuei  600: Finishes after 26 mins - Looks OK
    + nuei  300: Finishes 8 steps - Not obvious why crashes, but could be high gradients in ue parallel artificial viscosity
    + nuei  100: Finishes 9 steps, then killed by walltime (6h), explodes, see-saw parallel
    + nuei   50: Finishes 6 steps - Not obvious why crashes, but could be high gradients in ue parallel artificial viscosity
    + nuei    1: Finishes 5 steps, then killed by exceeded walltime (6h) - explodes - see-saw
    + nuei 1e-1: Finishes one step, then too small step size error - Not obvious why crashes, but could be high gradients in ue parallel artificial viscosity
-  PBSDriver-0-b-0-CollisionScan.py
    + nuei  600: Finishes after 7 mins, runs fine, has high grad on uepar artificial (but this falls after a while)
    + nuei  300: Finishes after 10 mins, looks fine
    + nuei  100: Finishes 7 steps, killed by walltime (6h), get wiggles
    + nuei   50: Finishes 15 steps, not sure why dies
    + nuei    1: Finishes 7 steps, not sure why dies
    + nuei 1e-1: Finishes 7 steps, not sure why dies
-  PBSDriver-0-c-0-CollisionScan.py
    + nuei  600: Finishes after 4 mins  - looks good
    + nuei  300: Finishes after 18 mins - looks good
    + nuei  100: Finishes after 26 mins - looks good
    + nuei   50: Finishes after 4h      - instability after
    + nuei    1: Finishes 13 steps, then killed by walltime (6h) - Instability
    + nuei 1e-1: Finishes 15 steps, then killed by walltime (6h) - Instability
