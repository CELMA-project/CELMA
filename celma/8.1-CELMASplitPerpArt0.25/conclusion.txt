- artPerp = 0.25
- Meant to compare start-up times with 8-CELMASplit

Results:
========
Getting backgrounds with nz = 2
-------------------------------
I.e. runs with a leading 0 in their serial number
NOTE: No perturbations
NOTE IMEX FIXED STEP: Set to 1e-2
Finish ordering (best to worst)
0-a-2 - Finished after 9m
0-a-1 - Finished after 9m
0-a-0 - Finished after 9m
0-b-1 - Finished after 5h 51h
0-b-0 - Finished 19 timesteps, then killed by walltime (6h)
0-b-2 - Finished 18 timesteps, then killed by walltime (6h)
0-c-0 - Finished 11 timesteps, then SNES failed to converge -6 (33 m)
0-c-2 - Finished 9 timesteps, then SNES failed to converge -6 (25 m)
0-c-1 - Finished 9 timesteps, then SNES failed to converge -6 (28 m)

Conclusion:
-----------
High speed-up with cvode
IMEX seems to be more unstable
