Dilemma
========
- How to deal with phi?
  * Full phi is found from non-linear inversion of vortD
  * Full phi can also be found from vort (linear)
    + vort is not evolved in time...or...is it?

Regression: we need also to linearize ddt(vortD)
Assume that the equilibrium does not evolve with time
Notice: Get a term:
ddt(n1 grad_perp(phi0)) = grad_perp(phi0)*ddt(n1)+n1**ddt(grad_perp(phi0))
                        = grad_perp(phi0)*ddt(n1)
!!! This means that ddt(vortD) goes to ddt(vort)
As we have vort, we can find phi (the full phi)
??? Does it make sense to split phi into phi0 and phi1?
In simple drift wave:

Eureka:
- Will now have a perturbed vort and a background vort
  * The background vort would need to be imported
    + Which means that it needs to be saved
    + One could:
        1 - Run until steady state nz=1
        2 - Expand run (run a few timesteps
        3 - Run for one timestep, and save all variables
        4 - Read the variable into SLEPc





Results:
