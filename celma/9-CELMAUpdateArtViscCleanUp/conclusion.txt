- Made it impossible to run with simpleStupid and onlyBrackets
- Fixed parallel artificial diffusion in density
- Removed n in artificial dissipation of velocities
- Runs do now have artifical dissipation in vortD

-------------------------------------------
0-a-0               : Finished after 32 min
1-a-0               : Finished after 52 min
2-a-0 hyperV 0      : Finished 48 steps, Naulin Solver failed after 8h 31m, ring mode starts, then something happens at the center, large negative vort
2-a-0 hyperV 1      : Finished 57 steps, timestep failed after 6h 15m, mode evolving to non-linear, large negative vort
2.1-a-0-noViscVortD hyperV 0: Finished 25 steps (48 h), then killed by walltime, growth of non-linear perturbation, get high values on "the ring"
2.1-a-0-noViscVortD hyperV 1: Finished 39 steps (48 h), then killed by walltime, lot of wiggles growing up at edge
