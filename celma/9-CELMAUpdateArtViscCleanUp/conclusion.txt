- Made it impossible to run with simpleStupid and onlyBrackets
- Fixed parallel artificial diffusion in density
- Removed n in artificial dissipation of velocities
- Runs do now have artifical dissipation in vortD

-------------------------------------------
0-a-0               : Finished after 32 min
1-a-0               : Finished after 52 min
2-a-0 hyperV 0      : Finished 48 steps, Naulin Solver failed after 8h 31m, ring mode starts, then something happens at the center, large negative vort
2-a-0 hyperV 1      : Finished 57 steps, timestep failed after 6h 15m, mode evolving to non-linear, large negative vort
2.1-a-0-noViscVortD hyperV 0: Finished 25 steps (48 h), then killed by walltime, growth of non-linear perturbation, get high values on "the ring"
2.1-a-0-noViscVortD hyperV 1: Finished 39 steps (48 h), then killed by walltime, lot of wiggles growing up at edge

-----------------
## As original (timestep = 1)
b-0 : Finished 18 step [which were done in < 20min] (1h 04m), then timestep failed
      Less diffuse n, more diffuse Omega
      uE and vort perturbations growing up on edge (also see decrease in n there)
b-0v2 : Finished 18 steps (1 h)
      Have high/low vort in the system
      Do not see uE perturbation grow up

## With new viscosities
b-1 : Finished 2 steps [which were done in < 1min] (1h 10m), then timestep failed
      Less diffuse n, more diffuse Omega
      uE and vort perturbations growing up on edge (also see decrease in n there)
b-1v2 : Finished 3 steps (timestep of 10) in 1h
      Get low vorticity and troubles at wall in ue (although still high
      perturbations in ue and ui)

## LowerArtPerpVortD
b-2 : Finished 1 step [which were done in < 1min] (1h 10m), then timestep failed
      None of the troubles above, but see-sawing in vortD parallel...due to
      viscosity...
b-2v2 : Finished 2 steps [of timestep 10] in 57 m
      Cannot see the instability, but get higher fluctuations in ue

## As original, higher nuEI
b-3 nuEI 1.5e-2: Finished 18 steps (1h 1m), then timestep failed
                 ue perturbations on the edge, less density at the edge etc
b-3 nuEI 2e-2  : Finished 18 steps (1h 10m), then timestep failed
                 ue perturbations on the edge, less density at the edge etc

b-3v2 nuEI 1.5e-2: Finished 18 steps (1h 6m)
                 Get high vorticity, maybe ue is starting on edge
b-3v2 nuEI 2e-2  : Finished 18 steps (57 m)
                 Get high vorticity, maybe ue is starting on edge


IDEA: DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF POINTS
IDEA: HIGHER DIFFUSIVITIES
IDEA: COULD BE SYSTEM IS EVOLVING THROUGH TRANSIENT PHASE
