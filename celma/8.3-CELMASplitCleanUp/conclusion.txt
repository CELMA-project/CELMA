- Re-added old viscosity on ln_n
+ See conclusion 9 and 9.1 for details

========
a-data
-------

## As original
a-0 : Finished after 53 m - Looks OK

## Add only visc on VortDperp
a-1 : Finished after 56 m - Turbulence dies

## Add only visc on VortDpar .
a-2 : Finished after 52 m - Less turbulence than original (easiest to see in Omega and OmegaD)

## No az hyper added
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-3 : !Finer structures created - Finished 9 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 51m)
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-4 : !Finer structures created - Finished 7 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 48m)
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-5 : !Finer structures created - Finished 6 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 43m)

## Short runs only visc on VortDperp scan
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-3 : Finished after 58 m - Not big difference between runs (a bit less trubulence in OmegaD)
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-4 : Finished after 55 m - Not big difference between runs
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-5 : Finished after 56 m - Not big difference between runs

## Long runs only visc on VortDperp scan
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-3 : Finished 189 steps (10h 26m), then too small time-step, not clear why on regular plots
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-4 : Finished  51 steps (3h 32m), then too small time-step, not clear why on regular plots
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-5 : Finished  53 steps (3h 39m), then too small time-step, not clear why on regular plots






b-longer/
---------

## As original short run (but longer)
b-0 : Finished after 34 m - More turbulence, more plasma in column, higher par art visc (347), ue very turbulent (max min 10)

## As original long run (but longer)
b-0 : Finished after 4h 5m - OK turbulence, more plasma in column, higher par art visc (347), ue very turbulent (max min 10)






b.1-longerNeumannO4
-------------------
Note that these runs are running WITHOUT viscosities in the vorticity

## As original short run (but longer)
b-1 : Finished after 32 m - More turbulence, more plasma in column, higher par art visc (347), ue very turbulent (max min 10) overall the same behaviour as b, but starting to differ (chaotic?)

## As original long run (but longer)
b-1 : Finished after 4 h 11 m - More plasma in column, higher par art visc

## Less art visc par
b.1-1 artPar 5/2: Finished after 4h 1m
b.1-1 artPar 5/4: Finished 5 steps (1h 20m), then timestep failed
b.2-1 artPar 5/4: Finished 5 steps (1h 20m), then timestep failed





Conclusion
----------
Added perp vort in vortD - turbulence dies
Taking away hypervisc creates finer structures
