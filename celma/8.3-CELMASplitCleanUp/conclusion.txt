- Re-added old viscosity on ln_n
+ See conclusion 9 and 9.1 for details

Results:
========
a-data
-------
a-0 : Finished after 53 m - Looks OK
a-1 : Finished after 56 m - Turbulence dies
a-2 : Finished after 52 m - Less turbulence than original (easiest to see in Omega and OmegaD)
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-3 : !Finer structures created - Finished 9 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 51m)
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-4 : !Finer structures created - Finished 7 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 48m)
a-3 artViscVortD 5e-5 : !Finer structures created - Finished 6 steps, then too small timesteps (1h 43m)
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-3 : Finished after 58 m - Not big difference between runs (a bit less trubulence in OmegaD)
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-4 : Finished after 55 m - Not big difference between runs
a-4 artViscVortD 5e-5 : Finished after 56 m - Not big difference between runs


Conclusion
----------
Added perp vort in vortD - turbulence dies
Taking away hypervisc creates finer structures
