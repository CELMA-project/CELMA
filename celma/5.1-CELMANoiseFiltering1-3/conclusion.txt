-------------------------------------------------------
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0-CompareW5CELMA0h0.py
    + nuEI  25: Runs 5 steps, then too small steps (11h) - Looks fine, can see that the vorticity starts with small ring-shape, touches the wall and goes back
    + nuEI   5: Finishes 3 steps, then killed by walltime (24h) - Looks fine, mode structures and probably start of turbulence
    + nuEI 0.1: Finishes 2 steps, then killed by walltime (24h) - Looks fine, mode structures and probably start of turbulence
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.2-1-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI5.py
    + nuEI   5: Finished 2 steps, then too small step (17h) - See nice 3 mode
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.2-2.1-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI5.py
    + nuEI   5: Finished 4 steps, then Naulin Solver crashes after small timesteps (2h) - Start with 3 mode, then evolves to 4 mode !!! Problems at the boundaries
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.2-2.2-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI5.py
    # Same as 0-a-0.2-2.1, but with ending the simulation after 100 omci
    + nuEI   5: Finishes after 1h 2m - Looks fine
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.2-3-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI5.py
    # Restart of 0-a-0.2-2.2
    + nuEI   5: To be run
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.3-1-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI0.1.py
    + nuEI 0.1: Finished after 1 timetep, killed by walltime (24h) - Looks OK - 3 mode
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0.3-2-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI0.1.py
    + nuEI 0.1: Running
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0-1-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI25.py
    # Restart of 0-a-0
    + nout 50 timestep  2: Finished after 19 mins - Looks OK, can see vort out on the boundary, and growing
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0-2-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI25.py
    # Restart of 0-a-0-1
    + nout 100 timestep  2: Finished 55 steps, then too small timesteps (44 min) - last couple of steps gives counter rotation in vort at high velocity
-  PBSDriver-0-a-0-2-CompareW5CELMA0h0RestartNuEI25PLOTTING1.py
    # Just plotting of 0-a-0-2
    + See structure rotating, then at one point fast blob coming out of nowhere in the vorticity
