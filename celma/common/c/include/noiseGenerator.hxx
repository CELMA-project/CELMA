 *
 * \brief Add noise in cylinder geometry
 *
 * This class provides noise generators for adding noise in cylinder geometry
 * by adding a reasonable perturbation with random phases.
 * The noise is made on a cartesian grid, and then interpolated to a cylinder
 * grid
 *
 * \warning The following is only suitable if using a cylindrical Clebsch
 *          coordinate system
