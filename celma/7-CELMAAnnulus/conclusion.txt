    + offset 1: Finished after 1 steps, killed by walltime (6h) - Some modes growing up (more star pattern at the edge)

    + nuei  100:
        * offset 1: Finishes 9 steps, then killed by walltime (24h) - See some turbulence like stuff in phi (with 2-mode)
        * offset 2: Running (previous did not exit program properly)
        * offset 5: Finishes 9 steps, then killed by walltime (24h) - Some modes, but disappearing

Comparision of 5-CELMAWNoise/0-c-5-1 and 7-CELMAAnnulus/0-a-1
-------------------------------------------------------------
Could be that the two encompass different physics, but for now it looks
like the annulus solution is not the reason why Jarrods HERMES
implementation is faster

+ nuei 100, artPar 1e0:
    1. 0-c-5-1
        * Finishes (10h 2m) and developes 1 mode
    2. 0-a-1
        * offset 1:
            Killed by walltime (24 h) [could be that modes are developing]
        * offset 2:
            Running
        * offset 5:
            Killed by walltime (24 h) [some modes present, but they are disappearing]

+ nuei 200, artPar 1e0:
    1. 0-c-5-1
        * Finishes (7h 25min) develops 1 mode, but unsure if finishes developement
    2. 0-a-1
        * offset 1:
            Running
        * offset 2:
            Running
        * offset 5:
            Running
