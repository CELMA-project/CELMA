Copied from 8-CELMASplit

- No division by n in the artificial viscosity
- Meant to compare start-up times with 8-CELMASplit

Results:
========
Getting backgrounds with nz = 2
-------------------------------
I.e. runs with a leading 0 in their serial number
NOTE: No perturbations
NOTE IMEX FIXED STEP: Set to 1e-2
Finish ordering (best to worst)
0-a-0 - Finished after 30 m
0-a-1 - Finished after 33 m
0-a-2 - Finished after 34 m
0-b-1 - Finished after 3h 32m
0-b-0 - Finished after 3h 47m
0-b-2 - Finished after 3h 54m
0-c-0 - Didn't even finish 1 timestep
0-c-1 - Didn't even finish 1 timestep
0-c-2 - Didn't even finish 1 timestep

Conclusion:
-----------
Speed-up with cvode
Speed-up with adaptive IMEX
