- Made model split
  NOTE: The split is ignored for non-split solvers, and the rhs will simply be
        the sum of the split
- Parallel current terms now combined (numerical operators should resemble
  conserved quantities)
- Changed Grad_par with DDY (Grad_par divides by sqrt(g_22))

Results:
========
Getting backgrounds with nz = 2
-------------------------------
I.e. runs with a leading 0 in their serial number
NOTE: No perturbations
NOTE IMEX FIXED STEP:
    Initially tried with timestep 1.0e0, but SNES failed reason -3
    Initially tried with timestep 1.0e-1, but SNES failed reason -3
Finish ordering (best to worst)
0-a-2 - 1h 11m
0-a-1 - 1h 18m
0-a-0 - 1h 21m
0-b-0 - Running
0-b-1 - Running
0-b-2 - Running
0-c-0 - Running
0-c-1 - Running
0-c-2 - Running


Expanding to 128
----------------
I.e. runs with a leading 1 in their serial number

f = DataFile_netCDF(filename="BOUT.restart.0.nc")
f.read("vortD")
vortD = f.read("vortD")


a-data
------
Not yet implemented

c-had to change timestep 1.0 snes failed
c-had to change timestep 1.0e-2 snes failed reason -3

Checkme:
The div(ueDotGrad(nGrad(phi))) should in principle NOT be active
Thus, in principle only need one run to restart from

Could in principle check for difference in hypervisc
(this would be more important when more z points)
