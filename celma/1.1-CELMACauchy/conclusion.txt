        !!! For some reason the source is not plotted
        * Cylinder is heavily filled
        ! Density is fixed too low
        * Other profiles are more consistent with intuition
        * Radial profiles are unexpected...much more plasma
        * Reaches ln_n = -0.8
        ! Sharp gradients edge
        ! Crashes at om_ci = 60
    + SAmp 5.0e-3
        !!! For some reason the source is not plotted
        * As above
        * Reaches ln_n = -1.228
        ! Sharp gradients edge
        ! COMPLETES THE RUN!

    :D Runs very fast
    ! Sharp gradients towards the radial boundary...more plasma in the box
    ! Still doesn't plot the source...bug?
    + SAmp 1.0e-2
        ! Crashes at om_ci = 60
    + SAmp 5.0e-3
        ! COMPLETES THE RUN
        * Doesn't look too bad, but not too good at source plate


BUG: No source plotting in line-plot?
     Plots just fine when not on cluster
