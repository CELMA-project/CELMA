        !!! For some reason the source is not plotted
        * Cylinder is heavily filled
        ! Density is fixed too low
        * Other profiles are more consistent with intuition
        * Radial profiles are unexpected...much more plasma
        * Reaches ln_n = -0.8

################### WRONG SOURCE #############################
In this block the source amplitude 'a' was supposed to be set, but the 'a' was
instead set to 's' (i.e. the source was homogeneously set to one value)

    ! Still doesn't plot the source...bug?

All runs until this point: Plasma is being emptied
IDEA: Have the source running all the way
