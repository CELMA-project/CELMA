- Added parallel collisionality in the density
- Removed 1/n from u viscosity
- Made all viscosities changeable between hypervisc and normal visc

Results:
========
a-data
-------
a-0-R8-2e31 : Parallel instability after 10 timesteps also some in rho, also some in rho
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e+1 : Timestep failed before finishing 1 step
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e-0 : Naulin solver failed
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e-1 : Timestep failed before finishing 1 step
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e-2 : Parallel instability occurs, also some in rho
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e-3 : Parallel instability occurs, also some in rho
a-1-R8-2e31 parVisc 5e-4 : Parallel instability occurs, also some in rho


b-data
-------
b-0-R8-2e31-noMod: Instabilities in rho


Conclusion
----------
Is the things happening in rho happening at the boundary?
Looks like YES...four equidistant rings growing up

Hypothesis: Small error at the boundary grows up and makes it all crash
