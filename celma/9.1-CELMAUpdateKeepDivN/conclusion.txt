-----------------
## Short run
b-0 : Finished after 1 min
      n becomes less diffuse
## Long run
b-0 : Finished 2 steps (< 5 min), then timestep failed (59 min)
      n becomes less diffuse
      ue gets some high perturbation on edge

## v2 restart
b-0-R8.3b10v2 : Finished 17 timesteps in 57 mins
    Have high vort somewhere in the system
    Do not observe the ue perturbations
