  NOTE: This is does not use ownOperators, but rather bracket(((DDXPhi)^(2.0)), n, bm)!!!
- Check that {(partial_rho phi)^2, n} is convergent

Results:
========
- mixModeAndGaussian: Converges
  + Note that phi is double symmetric, but n is not
  + The symmetry of S does not coincide with phi

Conclusion:
===========
Get expected convergece :D
