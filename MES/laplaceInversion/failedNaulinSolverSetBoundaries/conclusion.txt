- Check that Naulin Solver implementation is correct

Checklist:
---------
[x] - Functions to take derivates of are properly communicated
[x] - Function of a field sets boundaries
[x] - Assignment operator sets boundaries

Results:
========
Naulin solver blew up (observed that this has to do with boundaries)

A method which is find to give good result is found in
4.3.1-CYTO_Naulin_phi_0_corrected_own_Nalin_impl/out_flag_0/
This however forces the boundary to 0
