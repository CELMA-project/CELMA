- Check that Naulin Solver implementation is correct using phi=0 on the
  boundaries
NOTE: Blow-up in the solver is observed if phi is not set to 0

Results:
========
- twoGaussians: Converging
- twoGaussiansSwapped: Converging
- twoNormalGaussians: Converging

Conclusion:
===========
Got 2nd order convergence as expected :D
