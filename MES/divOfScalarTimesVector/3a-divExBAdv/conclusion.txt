- simpleGaussian:
  + Not converging
  + High error on inner rho
- simpleGaussianW0AtEdge:
  + Not converging
  + High error on inner rho
- twoGaussians:
  + Not converging
  + High error on inner rho
- twoGaussiansSwapped:
  + Not converging
  + High error on inner rho
- twoNormalGaussians:
  + Not converging
  + High error on inner rho

Conclusion:
===========
We are multiplying with 1/J^4, this is expected to destroy the convergence
