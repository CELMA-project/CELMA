- Check convergence for divSource

Results:
========
- twoGaussians:
  + L2   = 2.0
  + Linf = 1.82
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
- twoGaussiansSwapped:
  + L2   = 1.50
  + Linf = 1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
- twoNormalGaussians:
  + Starts with convergence
  + L2   = -0.36
  + Linf = -1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! divergence !!!

Conclusion:
===========
Unsure why divergence on twoNormalGaussians
Other than that: Expected convergence :D
