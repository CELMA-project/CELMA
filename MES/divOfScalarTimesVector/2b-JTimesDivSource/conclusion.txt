- Check convergence for J*divSource

Results:
========
- twoGaussians: Convergence
- twoGaussiansSwapped: Convergence
- twoNormalGaussians:
  + Starts with convergence
  + L2   = 2.00
  + Linf = -0.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! divergence !!!

Conclusion:
===========
Unsure why divergence on twoNormalGaussians, could be hitting machine
precession
Other than that: Expected convergence :D
