- simpleGaussianW0AtEdge:
  + Converges
  + Reaches machine precession
  ! Highest error around guards
  ! Diverges at the end
- simpleGaussian:
  + Converges
  + Reaches machine precession
  ! Diverges at the end
- twoGaussians:
  + Converges
  + Reaches machine precession
- twoGaussianSwapped:
  + Converges
  + Reaches machine precession
  ! Diverges at the end
- twoNormalGaussian:
  + Converges
  + Reaches machine precession
  ! Diverges at the end

Conclusion:
===========
Converges
Looks like reaches machine precession
Error at boundaries looks different
