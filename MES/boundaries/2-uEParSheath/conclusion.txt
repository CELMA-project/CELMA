Copied from 1-yExtrapolation/

- Check that extrapolation is set properly

Results:
========
- gaussianWSinAndParabola:
  Linf: 1.0
  L2:   1.5
  Could be that this is bad function to test due to
  1. Profile has y-dependency
  2. Function itself is bad
  Possible to check this by checking the taylor series
- noYDepInProf:
  Linf: 4.0 until last point
  L2:   4.0 until last point
  Looks like machine precession reached

Conclusion:
===========
Looks like gives expected convergence
Note also that the absolute values of the errors varies a lot
