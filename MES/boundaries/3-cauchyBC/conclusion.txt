- Check that the cauchy BC is set correctly

Results:
========
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: 1st order convergence
- noXDepInFunc: 1st order convergence


Conclusion:
===========
For some reason: All trials here (see cauchyMethods.txt and
derivations/bounadries/) have given 1st order convergence.
Proceed with care
