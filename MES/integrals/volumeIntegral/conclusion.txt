- Check that the volume integral is properly working

Results:
========
- sumSines    : Looks to be converging, but not in z
                dx = 1.88 (errors ABOVE 1e-6)
                dy = 1.58 (errors ABOVE 1e-6)
                dz = 0.00 (errors around 1e-6)

                Explanation: z is periodic, and we are here using sum of
                             sines

- sumSinesHat : Looks to be converging, but not in z
                dx =  1.56 (errors ABOVE 1e-6)
                dy =  1.88 (errors ABOVE 1e-6)
                dz = -0.01 (errors around 1e-6)

                Explanation: Just a hypothesis: The tanh is working, but is
                computed accurately already with 2^4 points/it's not contributing
                to the integral

- zHat        : Gives convergence
                dz = 2.00 (errors goes to around 1e-8)

- zSines      : Does not converge in z (small errors though)
                dz = -0.02 (errors around 1e-9)

                Explanation: z is periodic, and we are here using sum of
                             sines
Conclusion:
===========
Probably converging, but needs a better function
