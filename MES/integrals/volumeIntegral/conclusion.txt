- Check that the volume integral is properly working

Results:
========
- sumSines    : Looks to be converging, but not in z
- sumSinesHat : Looks to be converging, but not in z
- zHat        : Gives convergence
- zSines      : Does not converge in z (small errors though)

Conclusion:
===========
To be run
