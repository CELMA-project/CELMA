- Check that (1/J)*DDX(J*f) is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
- gaussian:
  + L2   = 1.5
  + Linf = 1.0
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  ! NOTE: Extremely sharp gradients in S close to center
- gaussianWSinAndParabola:
  + L2   = 1.5
  + Linf = 1.0
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
- properZ:
  + L2   = 1.5
  + Linf = 1.0
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  ! NOTE: We get a blow up in S here
- properZModified:
  !!! Convergence broken
  !!! Biggest error from inner rho
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good here
- simpleX:
  !!! L2   = 1.16
  !!! Linf = 0.63
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  ! NOTE: Extremely sharp gradients close to inner rho

Conclusion:
===========
- First order convergence explained in subConvergence.ipynb
- Still a mystery why convergence is broken somewhere
  Checked if has something with one term being much larger than another
  Hypothesis: A workaround could be to multiply with J
