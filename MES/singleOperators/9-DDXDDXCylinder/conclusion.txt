- Check that DDX on DDX is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
- gaussian:
  + L2   = -0.5
  + Linf = -1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! First derivative is mulivalued in rho = 0
-mixMode:
  + L2   = 2.0
  + Linf = 2.0


Conclusion:
===========
It may appear that this does not give proper convergence when one look at
"gaussian", which is convergent for D2DX2(f), but not for DDX(DDX(f)).
The reason why the convergence is not found is that DDX(f) is multivalued at
rho = 0.
