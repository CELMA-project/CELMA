Copied from DDXDDXCylinder

- Check that DDX on DDX is working in cylinder geometry
- Cleaned so only simplest implemetation is present

Results:
========
- properZ:
  + L2   = -0.5
  + Linf = -1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! Diverges
- gaussian: Converges
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Converges

Conclusion:
===========
Unsure why properZ diverges...
