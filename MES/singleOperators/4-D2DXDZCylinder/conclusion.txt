- Check that DDX(DDZ(f)) is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
- properZ:
  + L2   = 1.99
  + Linf = 0.19
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  + Starts with proper convergence
  !!! Does not converge
- gaussian: Converges
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Converges

Conclusion:
===========
Unsure why properZ does not converge
Other than that: Proper convergence :D
