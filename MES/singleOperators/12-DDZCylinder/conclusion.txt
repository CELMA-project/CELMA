Copied from D2DX2Cylinder

- Check that own implementation of D3DZ3 is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
- properZ:
  + Too simple function in z, hits machine precission right away
  + Divergence behaviour is due to lack of precission
- gaussian:
  + Converges in the first point, then hits machine precission
  + Divergence behaviour is due to lack of precission
- gaussianWSinAndParabola:
  + Converges in the two first points, then hits machine precission
  + Divergence behaviour is due to lack of precission

Conclusion:
===========
Implementation is good
