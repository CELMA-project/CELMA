- Check that DDX(DDX(f)) is working in cylinder geometry with, when one use 6th order at
  the 2 innermost point for DDX(f), and a normal second order for DDX(DDX(f))


Results:
========
- gaussian: Diverge
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Diverge

Conclusion:
===========
Apparently diverges because DDX(f) is multivalued when rho -> 0
