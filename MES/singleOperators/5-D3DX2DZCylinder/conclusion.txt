Copied from D3DX2DZCylinder

- Check that D2DX2(DDZ(f)) is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
- properZ: Converges until 4 last points, then diverges
  + L2: - 0.5
  + Linf: - 1.5
  + S looks fine
  !!! DIVERGES !!!
- gaussian: Converges until last point
  + L2: 1.99
  + Linf: 1.68
  + S looks fine
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Converges until last point
  + L2: 2.00
  + Linf: 1.94
  + S looks fine

Conclusion:
===========
Unsure why not converges last point
Unsure why Z converges
Other than that: Proper convergence :D
