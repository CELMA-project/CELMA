- Check that D4DY4 is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
With neumann boundary condition:
Should formally only give 1st order convergence according to
derivations/D4DX4/BW2ndOrderNeumann4thOrder.ipynb
(should first deviate at 5th derivative)

It is expected that the dirichlet_o4 does not give proper convergence when
looking at the taylor expansion for extrapolation to the last grid point

- gaussianNeumann               : Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision at 256 points
- gaussianWSinAndParabolaNeumann: Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision at 1024 points
- highVarYNeumann               : Almost 2nd order observed after 256 points, small errors, but maybe not machine precision

- gaussian                      : Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision at 256 points
- gaussianWSinAndParabola       : Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision at 1024 points
- highVarY                      : Almost 2nd order observed after 256 points, small errors, but maybe not machine precision

Conclusion:
===========
Neumann: Convergence observed
Dirichlet: Looks like converge (bad test functions?)
