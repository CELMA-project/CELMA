- Check that D4DX4 is working in cylinder geometry

Results:
========
With neumann boundary condition:
Should formally only give 1st order convergence according to
derivations/D4DX4/BW2ndOrderNeumann4thOrder.ipynb
(should first deviate at 5th derivative)

It is expected that the dirichlet_o4 does not give proper convergence when
looking at the taylor expansion for extrapolation to the last grid point

- gaussianNeumann        : Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision
- mixModeNeumann         : Actually observed 2nd order convergence until machine precision
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Convergence not observed (blow up last point)
- gaussian               : Convergence not observed (blow up last point)

Conclusion:
===========
Neumann: Convergence observed
