Results:
========
- properZ:
  + L2   = 0.5
  + Linf = 0.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! No convergence
- gaussian:
  + L2   = -0.5
  + Linf = -1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! Diverges
- gaussianWSinAndParabola:
  + L2   = -0.5
  + Linf = -1.00
  + Error dominates at inner rho
  + S looks good
  !!! Diverges

Conclusion:
===========
Not proper divergence
