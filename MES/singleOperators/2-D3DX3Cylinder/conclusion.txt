Copied from D3DX3Cylinder

- Check that own implementation of D3DX3 is working in cylinder geometry
  without using 2 ghost cells


Results:
========
- Initially needed something which needed 2 ghost point
  !!! FIXED
- properZ:
  !!! Seems like inner rho is wrong
  - If use properZ => get convergence
  - If out comment innerRhoCylinder(f); => get convergence
  - DDX(f) also have trouble with first point for 2048 points
  ! CONCLUSION, properZ is a bad function as it is multivalued around the
    center, hence it is not smooth, and convergence cannot be expected
- gaussian: Convergence
- gaussianWSinAndParabola: Convergence, reaching machine precision


Conclusion:
===========
Expected convergence, with exception of properZ, which is multivalued in origo
Note that innerRhoCylinder is working, as the other functions are not
symmetric (note also that they go toward one value as rho->0 [That is: The
functions does not "wiggle" close to rho=0 in a rho, theta plot])
