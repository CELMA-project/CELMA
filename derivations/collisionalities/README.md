in Shroeder, C. - Ph.D. Thesis (2003)
[CompareArNeutCollisionsWSchroeder.py](CompareArNeutCollisionsWSchroeder.py) -
Calculates the ion-neutral collision for Argon and compares it with the
result in Shroeder, C. - Ph.D. Thesis (2003)
[parameters.py](parameters.py) - Contains formulas for calculating
plasma parameters.
