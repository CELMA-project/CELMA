# ghostPointExtrapolation

* [boundary4thNoGhost.ipynb](boundary4thNoGhost.ipynb) - the two are the same,
  noGhost assumes that the boundary is a physical point, not sure why the file
  exists
  uses the points xb x0 x1 x2 x3 and x0 x1 x2 x3 xb
* [boundary4thOrder.ipynb](boundary4thOrder.ipynb) - Should be renamed:
  4thOrderDirichletGhostPointPolynomial
* [dividedDifferences.py](dividedDifferences.py) - Helper files to calculate
  the divided differences coefficients and the divided differences polynomials
* [ghost4thOrder.ipynb](ghost4thOrder.ipynb)
* [ghost5thOrder.ipynb](ghost5thOrder.ipynb)
* [ghost6thOrder.ipynb](ghost6thOrder.ipynb)
