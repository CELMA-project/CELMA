* 2.0-CELMACurMomIMEX - As 1, but using IMEX
* 2.1-CELMACurMomIMEXJParEdit - As 2.0, but added stiff jPar terms to the diffusive part
* 2.2-CELMACurMomIMEXJParEdit2 - As 2.1, but removed the least stiff jPar terms to the diffusive part
* 2.3-CELMACurMomIMEXJParEdit3 - As 2.2, but removed the least stiff jPar terms to the diffusive part
â–¸ 3.0-CELMACurMomWMonitors - As 1, but added monitors
