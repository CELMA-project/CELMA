- Reverted split to rhs (found that IMEX is currently not robust enough)
- Combined lnN and phi to the same derivative in jPar
- Cleaned up in BOUT.inp
- Added input routine
- Changed source to flat

Looks like low B fills the whole column
both if source go to end and if not

A bit of a mystery still...does seem to change anything when B is changing
Also, when changed machine, nothing really happened

Still try: Higher artificial perp...but wait...these are also comparable

Things left:
* Ratio
* Len of cyl
* A bit higher collisionality


Checked:
[x] Initialization is the same
[x] Equations are the same
[ ] Art visc are the same
[ ] Source is the same
