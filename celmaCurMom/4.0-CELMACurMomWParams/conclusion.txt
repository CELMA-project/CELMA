Copied from 3.0-CELMACurMomWMonitors

- Reverted split to rhs (found that IMEX is currently not robust enough)
- Combined lnN and phi to the same derivative in jPar
- Cleaned up in BOUT.inp
- Added input routine
- Changed source to flat

Checklist:
[ ] - Fields steady state
[ ] - All OK on expand
[ ] - Linear modes: Radial and poloidal
[ ] - Turbulence (long, include parallel structures) ... turbulence level would be nice
[ ] - Profiles during linear - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Profiles during turbulence - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Time of energy overshoot
[ ] - Probe data
