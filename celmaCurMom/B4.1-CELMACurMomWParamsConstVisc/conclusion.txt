- Using the boussineq approximation as described in the thesis

Checklist:
[ ] - Fields steady state
[ ] - All OK on expand
[ ] - Linear modes: Radial and poloidal
[ ] - Turbulence (long, include parallel structures) ... turbulence level would be nice
[ ] - Profiles during linear - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Profiles during turbulence - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Time of energy overshoot
[ ] - Probe data

a2-KiwiFlatMagFieldTi0                - To be run
a2-KiwiFlatMagFieldTi0BoutRunnerNoise - Rerun
    noise 1e-3  - Worked
    noise 1e-15 - Ring mode
    noise 1e-10 - Worked, except for
        * B0 - 1.0e-1 - Tried twice, no success, note that it enters turbulent state on restart
        * B0 - 9.0e-2 - Tried twice, no success, note that it enters turbulent state on restart
    noise 1e-6 - As 1e-10. There is a small mode growing up, but is damped.
