- Using the boussineq approximation as described in the thesis

Checklist:
[ ] - Fields steady state
[ ] - All OK on expand
[ ] - Linear modes: Radial and poloidal
[ ] - Turbulence (long, include parallel structures) ... turbulence level would be nice
[ ] - Profiles during linear - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Profiles during turbulence - still grid size oscillation?
[ ] - Time of energy overshoot
[ ] - Probe data

    noise 1e-3  - Worked, except
                * B0 - 1.0e-1
                * B0 - 9.0e-2
    noise 1e-15 - Ring mode
    noise 1e-10 - Worked, except for
        * B0 - 1.0e-1 - Tried twice, no success, note that it enters turbulent state on restart
        * B0 - 9.0e-2 - Tried twice, no success, note that it enters turbulent state on restart
    noise 1e-6 - As 1e-10. There is a small mode growing up, but is damped.
  * B0 9.0e-2
    noise all? 1e-5  - 3000
        Counterclock smear (does not go beyond 1e13)
        5 mode growing up
        !!! No SHAKING (straight lines)
    noise all   1e-5  - 3001
        Counterclock until 1e12
        Clockwise 4 mode evolving to 5 mode
        !!! No SHAKING
    noise all   1e-10 - 2001
        Counterclock smear (going to 1e7 before decreasing)
        Shaky 4 mode clockwise (run stops at n=1e12)
        !!! Ringmodes are coming every now and then
    noise vortD 1e-6  - Small wobbles from 4-5 mode
    noise all   1e-6  - Also small wobbles (do not see transition from 4-5)
    noise all   1e-7  - More wobbles
    noise vortD 1e-7  - Wobbles a lot...also after transition 4-5
        Counterclock smear (going to 1e10 before decreasing)
        Shaky 4 mode (run stops at e14)
 * B0 1.0e-1
    noise all 1e-5  - 3000
        !!! No SHAKING (shaking until modes spin)
    noise all   1e-5  - 3001
        !!! No SHAKING (also not just straigth lines)
    noise all   1e-10 - 2001
        Heavy shaking at first until normal spin (are we then in non-linear)?
    noise vortD 1e-6  - A lot of wobbles until settles (before turb)
    noise all   1e-6  - Don't see the wobbles
    noise all   1e-7  - Don't see the wobbles
    noise vortD 1e-7  - Heavy wobbles until normal spin
        Heavy shaking until normal spin (are we then in non-linear)?
