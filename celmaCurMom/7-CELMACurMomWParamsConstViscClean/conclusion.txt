Running with same om_ci and rho_S as Ar
Want om_cAr = om_cH
 qB_Ar/m_Ar = qB_H/m_H
        B_H = B_Ar*m_H/m_Ar
        B_H = B_Ar*0.025231
=> heavily breaks the drift approximation
Idea:
1. Could run with drift approximation break
2. Could decrease n0, increase Te
3. Could just run with same parameters as article, using H

These papers breaks the drift approximation
