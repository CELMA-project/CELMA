- Reformulated to evolve parallel current and total parallel momentum

Results:
========


Currently something strange with the parallel current, ddt is high, originates
from the mu*n*phi term

Also: Density drops

0a0 !!!NOTE: Run to 2000!!! - Finished after 15 m
1a0                         - To be run



Tests
-----
TestEquilibriumChange         : Finished after 1m,
TestEquilibriumParArtViscScan : Too low viscosities gives see-saw patterns
TestRestartInitialize.py      : Will be run if longer one wants to approach the real steady state better
