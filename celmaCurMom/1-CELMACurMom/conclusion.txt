- Reformulated to evolve parallel current and total parallel momentum

Results:
========


Currently something strange with the parallel current, ddt is high, originates
from the mu*n*phi term

Also: Density drops




a-data (copied from 8.3-CELMACURMOMSplitCleanUp/b.1-longerNeumannO4/)
---------------------------------------------------------------
0a0 !!!NOTE: Run to 2000!!! : Finished after 14 m looks ok
1a0   : Finished after 13 m looks ok, a bit high current
2a0   : Finished after 33 m, can see a two mode
2.1a0 : Finished after 17 m, can see modes growing up



Tests
-----
TestEquilibriumChange         : Finished after 1m,
TestEquilibriumParArtViscScan : Too low viscosities gives see-saw patterns
TestRestartInitialize.py      : Will be run if longer one wants to approach the real steady state better
