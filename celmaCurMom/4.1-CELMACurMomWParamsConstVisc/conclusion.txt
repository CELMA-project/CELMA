Copied from 4.0-CELMACurMomWParams

- Added const visc flag: Viscosities are being held constant in a scan. ALSO
  when changing B!
- Better parameter display (as 5.0)
- New implementation of neutral collision

a1-KiwiFlatMagField - works ok
a1-KiwiFlatElTemp   - success 2/6
    Te = 14: Success
    Te = 12: SUNDIALS fails in linear phase
    Te = 10: SUNDIALS fails in linear phase
    Te =  8: SUNDIALS fails in linear phase
    Te =  6: Success
    Te =  5: SUNDIALS fails in linear phase
a1-KiwiFlatNeutral  - success 3/5
    nn = 1e15: Failed in Naulin Solver
    nn = 5e15: Sucess
    nn = 1e16: SUNDIALS fails in linear phase
    nn = 5e16: Success
    nn = 1e17: Success
a1-KiwiFlatZ  - Runs successfully, but unsatisfactory ring modes
    z =  1: Proper modes
    z =  2: Starts by blinking, then growing up properly
    z =  4: Thick outer mode
    z =  6: Thick outer mode
    z =  8: Thin outer mode
    z = 10: Thin outer mode


a2 series - Needs documentation

Seeded lnN 1e-5
a3-KiwiFlat-scanZTi_0 - Runs almost successfully, nice fluctuation patterns
    !!!!!!!!! POTENTIAL PITFALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!
              Looks like have super omci speeds of perturbation
              Could be that perturbation sitting on top of rotating plasma
    z =  4: Proper modes
    z =  5: Proper modes
    z =  6: Proper modes
    z =  8: Proper modes
    z = 10: Outer ring mode
    z = 12: Outer ring mode

Seeded vortD 1e-7
a2-KiwiFlatMagField   - !!!!!! Works ok for linear modes (code still crashes though)
a3-KiwiFlat-scanZTi_0 - Runs almost successfully, nice fluctuation patterns
    z = 10: Still some outer modes with vortD 1e-7
    z = 12: Still ring mode with vortD 1e-7

Seeded vortD 1e-5
    z = 10: Still some outer modes, but good mode becomes dominant
    z = 12: Outer ring mode (not the thin one) dominant

TODO:
1. Check if crashes can be explained by energy overshoot
2. Check if fails can be restarted from another turbulent state
